# Real Estate Price Prediction in Bangladesh
This project explores real estate data from Bangladesh and builds machine learning models to predict property prices. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and includes features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, floor area, and property prices across various cities.

## Data Source
- Dataset available on Kaggle: [Real Estate Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/durjoychandrapaul/house-price-bangladesh)

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Statsmodels)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- Dhaka has the highest average property prices compared to other cities.
- Property prices have a positive relationship with floor area but show variance due to factors like location and amenities.
- Ridge Regression performed the best among all models, balancing predictive power and preventing overfitting.

## How to Run the Analysis
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.
2. Install the required Python libraries.
3. Run the `real_estate_analysis.ipynb` notebook to replicate the analysis.
